A property is..


.. _existence:

Existence
---------

The existence property contains the wisdom of the existence of an element

According to the kind of US-node it is connected to, it can be implicit or to be made explicit.
An implicit existence is not mandatory nor suggested, an explicit existence should be declared.

An implicit existance is in the case of US/USM that are real elements you can see and touch. The same thing happens with the USV/s nodes that represents elements whose existence property is certain. 

Examples of existence to be made explicit are USD, USV/n and VSF whose certainty of existence should be justified by mentioning the main proof we have.
