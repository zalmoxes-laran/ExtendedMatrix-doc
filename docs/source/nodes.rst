Nodes of the EM
===============

Extended Matrix nodes include all the graphic elements on the two-dimensional canvas except for the connecting lines between them, which are called arcs or connectors.

Nodes are divided into three major families: stratigraphic units, sources, and interpretation and reasoning nodes.


.. _stratigraphicunits:

General background on stratigraphic units
-----------------------------------------

A stratigraphic unit in some acadmic scholarships is also known as locus or context. It indicates the result of an action that occurred at a specific moment in time. The result (the construction of a wall, the destruction of a roof, is the silt deposited on top of structures following a flood, the chemical change of surfaces due to a fire) in turn have a life span that ends with the moment it is defunctionalized (destroyed, abandoned, buried). 

Stratigraphic units that are of different types: real stratigraphic unit relating to something still existing or stratigraphically documented, documentary stratigraphic tip that the family of virtual stratigraphic units (relating to objects that no longer exist and need to be reconstructed). Abstract limits that are of different types: real stratigraphic unit relating to something still existing or stratigraphically documented, documentary stratigraphic tip that the family of virtual stratigraphic units (relating to objects that no longer exist and need to be reconstructed)

.. _us:

Stratigraphic Unit - US
-----------------------

It is the graphic and conceptual sign we use to number and define objects found still in situ (and noted using the techniques of stratigraphic reading).


.. _usd:

Documentary Stratigraphic Unit - USD
------------------------------------

The Documentary Stratigraphic Unit (USD) represents an element whose existence is certain due to a source considered reliable (a text, a drawing).

It connects to these properties:

* existence
* geometry
* etc..
