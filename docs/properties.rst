Properties of the EM
====================

What is a property ?
--------------------

A property is an element that defines a quality of the object to be represented. 
Properties include


.. _existence:

Existence
---------

The existence property contains the wisdom of the existence of an element.

According to the kind of US-node it is connected to, it can be implicit or to be made explicit.
An implicit existence is not mandatory nor suggested, an explicit existence should be declared.

An implicit existance is in the case of US/USM that are real elements you can see and touch. The same thing happens with the USV/s nodes that represents elements whose existence property is certain. 

Examples of existence to be made explicit are USD, USV/n and VSF whose certainty of existence should be justified by mentioning the main proof we have.  

.. _geometry:

Geometry
--------

The geometry property defines the dimensions of the object (length, width, thickness, shape).  
Within the Extended Matrix, the geometry property can be defined, for example, by a floor plan or photogrammetric model of the area to be reconstructed.

.. _placement:

Placement
--------

Placement is the property that defines the exact location of geometry, either in local or global coordinates. The main sources from which to infer the positioning property of geometry are technical drawings, excavation plans, and photogrammetric models.


.. _material:

Material
--------
Material property defines the material(s) of which the object is made. This characteristic can be inferred from various sources, such as excavation reports, ancient sources etc.


.. _color:

Color
--------
The color property defines the original color(s) of the object. As with the :ref:`material` property, it can be defined from excavation reports and ancient sources.
